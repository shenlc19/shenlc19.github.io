I am a third-year Master's student from the Institute of Data Sience and Information, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yuxing Han. Previously, I received my bachelor's degree at the School of Architecture, Tsinghua University. My research interests include neural rendering, 3D reconstruction and 3D generation. Inspired by my cross-disciplinary background, I am particularly interested in using AI to automate and streamline architectural design and urban planning.
