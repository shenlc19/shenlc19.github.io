I am a third-year Master's student from the Institute of Data Sience and Information, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yuxing Han. I also work as a research assistant at Institute for AI Research(AIR), Tsinghua University, under the supervision fo Professor [Hao Zhao](https://sites.google.com/view/fromandto). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in urban planning at the School of Architecture, Tsinghua University. My research interests include neural rendering, 3D reconstruction and 3D generation. Inspired by my cross-disciplinary background, I am particularly interested in using AI to automate and streamline architectural design and urban planning.
